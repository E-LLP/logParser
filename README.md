logParser
=========

I know this code sucks. It's my first attempt at a C++/Qt project. 

This piece of software takes an access.log Apache common log file (only format supported right now). It parses every line, and outputs :

- a report of 404 errors
- a report of URLs crawled by GoogleBot 

For each error, you get the URL and the number of hits.

You can save your report in a CSV file (readable by Microsoft Excel, LibreOffice...)

I'll update the code as often as I can to improve code readabily and performance, add new features, and so on.

Feel free to contact me :)
